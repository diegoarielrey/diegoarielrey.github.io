    <h1>About Diego Rey</h1>
    <p>Diego was born in Bariloche, Argentina, and moved to Palo Alto, CA, in 1989. Now based in San Francisco, Diego’s training is in Electrical Engineering (BS, UCSB) and Biophysics, Applied Engineering Physics, and Biomedical Engineering (PhD, Cornell University). Diego co-founded GeneWEAVE Biosciences (acquired by Roche) and Endpoint Health.</p>

    <p>GeneWEAVE developed tests to get the right antibiotic to patients quickly: in vitro diagnostics for the rapid detection and identification of live bacteria directly from patient specimens and phenotypic determination of antibiotic susceptibility. The system and first test for MRSA screening received a De Novo Grant from the FDA. Diego served as Chief Technology Officer, invented the core technology, and is the author of 27 issued patents.</p>

    <p>Endpoint Health developed therapeutics for immune-mediated diseases, including RA, IBD, Vasculitides, as well as Sepsis and ARDS. Endpoint’s key premise is that biological heterogeneity in these diseases limits efficacy potential and addressed this problem by developing blood-based transcriptomic tests (RNA seq and RT-qPCR) to stratify patients based on immune state to then better align therapy pharmacology to patient biology. At Endpoint, Diego served as Chief Scientific Officer and on the company’s Board of Directors.</p>

    <p>Diego was the first Visiting Partner at Y Combinator focused on life sciences and healthcare companies, where he helped founders build their companies developing diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, tools, health IT, and industrial biology products. He serves on the Cornell University College of Engineering Council and the Biomedical Engineering Advisory Council. Additionally, Diego is an angel investor with a portfolio that includes diagnostics, therapeutics, and healthcare delivery companies.</p>
