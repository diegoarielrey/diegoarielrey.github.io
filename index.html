    <p>I'm a scientist and entrepreneur based in San Francisco. My background is in Electrical Engineering (BS, UCSB) and Biophysics, Applied Engineering Physics, and Biomedical Engineering (PhD, Cornell University).</p>

    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.genengnews.com/news/roche-to-acquire-geneweave-for-up-to-425m/" target="_blank">GeneWEAVE</a> (acquired by Roche) and Endpoint Health. I've worked on diagnostics, therapeutics, and patient stratification using blood-based transcriptomic tests. My focus is on aligning biology and technology to improve care.</p>

    <p>I was the first Visiting Partner at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a> dedicated to healthcare, and I invest in companies working on diagnostics, therapeutics, health IT, and more.</p>
